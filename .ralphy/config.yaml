# Rules - instructions the AI MUST follow
# These are injected into every prompt
rules:
  - "Always use TypeScript strict mode"
  - "Use server actions instead of API routes in Next.js"
  - "Follow GSD (Get Shit Done) execution patterns from .agents/skills/gsd/"
  - "When executing a phase, read the PLAN.md file first and follow it exactly"
  - "Create atomic commits per task (one commit per task in the plan)"
  - "After completing a phase, create a SUMMARY.md file in the phase directory"
  - "Update .planning/STATE.md after each phase completion"
  - "Handle deviations automatically: fix bugs immediately, implement missing critical functionality if under 5 minutes"
  - "At checkpoints (human-action, human-verify), pause and wait for user input"
  - "For checkpoint tasks, document what user needs to do and verify after completion"
  - "Follow the execution context from @.agents/skills/gsd/workflows/execute-plan.md"
  - "Reference project context from .planning/PROJECT.md, .planning/ROADMAP.md, and .planning/STATE.md"
  - "All API endpoints must have input validation with Zod"
  - "Follow the error handling patterns established in the codebase"
  - "Use Supabase server client (@supabase/ssr) in Next.js; prefer Row Level Security (RLS) for data access"
  #
  # Skills/playbooks:
  - "Before coding, read and follow any relevant skill/playbook docs under .agents/skills/gsd/"
  - "Use GSD executor patterns for atomic commits and checkpoint handling"

# Boundaries - files/folders the AI should not modify
boundaries:
  never_touch:
    # Examples:
    # - "src/legacy/**"
    # - "migrations/**"
    # - "*.lock"
